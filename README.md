# ICU_HW
 The primary objective of this project is to create an embedded system with an ICU implemented by hardware. The ICU captures and measures external signals or events, providing accurate information about their timing or characteristics. This project will involve designing the hardware circuitry, interfacing with a microcontroller, and utilizing the captured data for specific applications
